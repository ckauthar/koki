                <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
                <p>Ethical hacking had intrigued me since high school but wasn't motivated enough as to pursue my interest. Being more matured and understanding, I have finally decided that I need to pursue my passion. Hopefully someday I could become the best of the best and be known for skills that I've encountered.</p>

                <h3>Front-End Developer</h3>
                <p>After working 3 years as an IT technician, I felt that it was time for a change and challenge. My first task for younglings was to create myself a portfolio and I went with a website. Within 2 weeks I had to teach myself html, css and a bit of javascript. I enjoyed creating the website, with some much passion. I'm doing freelance to constantly upgrade my skills and for portfolio purposes.</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>My story starts when I completed my NQF 4, Technical Support at Torque IT. I then got an internship at an IT company called TCM(Technology Corporate Management). Intially I started on projects, working at all absa branches across Cape Town. Then I started assisting at the new Regional Offices that's situated in Century City. I then became a site technician, and worked at the regional office for 3 years and 4 month. After my 3rd year, I felt it's time for a challenge and that I needed to prosper within my career. That's when I made the decision of giving up my job and upskill myself by pursuing cyber security, and front-end developing as a career.</p>
