        <h1>Hey, thanks for vieweing my portfolio website.</h1>

         <p>I have entered the IT world at the age of 19 years old. Started out as a Junior Customer Engineer, always just upskillinng myself and making a success of my career. I am ready to take level up within my IT career and will always do everything to the best of my ability.</p>

          <p>I'm sure that things will be challenging at first, but the moment I get the hang of things it'll all be much easier. I always remind myself that one cannot know everything in this world. Everyday is a learning curfew. There doesn't go a day by that one doesn't learn anything at all.</p>

           <p>To make a success of my career I have to believe within myself and that I can accomplish it all, ones attitude is everything. I believe that character can take you far in life, your character says alot about who you are.A constant reminder that I always bare in mind is that I should always be humble, positive and always smile, no matter what's happening in your life.</p>
          
            <p>My favorite saying is that, "Knowledge Is From The Craddle To The Grave".</p>
