       <h1>Hey, thanks for vieweing my portfolio website.</h1>

       <p>I have entered the journey of becoming a Software Engineer. Previously I was a Customer Engineer (Desktop Support), which was my job for 3 years of my life. I enjoy working with various races, cultures , tradition and religious people.</p>

         <p>I'm sure that things will be challenging at first, but the moment I get the hang of things it'll all be much easier. I always remind myself that one cannot know everything in this world. Everyday is a learning curfew. There doesn't go a day by that one doesn't learn anything at all.</p>
           
         <p>My favorite saying is that, "Knowledge Is From The Craddle To The Grave".</p>
